# REACT-to-KFlinn-Coding

## Purpose

As a bootcamp student, I want to display my work on an easily accessed site for future employers. I was not provided any HTML or CSS, but started completely from scratch and built it using React. It is set up in a way that is easy to navigate, with multiple pages, so that anyone may view an About section, my works, and find ways to contact me. This was achieved through Javascript, React, and various other NPM packages.
